# UI-UX-Experiment5

## Aim:
To Present 2 different UX project scenarios (e.g., designing a health app, an e-commerce site, or a government service portal).

## Algorithm:
~~~~
- User Research – Identify patient needs and healthcare provider requirements.
- Wireframe & Navigation – Create an intuitive UI for appointment booking, health tracking, and reports.
- Accessibility & Usability – Ensure easy navigation, readable fonts, and clear icons.
- Testing & Iteration – Gather feedback from users and refine interactions.
- Launch & Monitor – Deploy the app and continuously improve based on user engagement.

Scenario 1: Designing a Health & Wellness Mobile App
1. Problem Statements
User Pain Points:
 Users struggle to maintain motivation for regular exercise.
 Users are overwhelmed by fitness apps with complex interfaces.
 Lack of personalization in most health tracking tools.
UX Problem Statements:
 "Busy professionals need a way to stay consistent with their fitness goals
because their hectic schedules and lack of guidance make it diƯicult to build
habits, which results in declining motivation and abandoned fitness plans."
 "New fitness users need a way to access simple and personalized workout
routines because most apps are too complex or generic, which results in
confusion and poor engagement."
2. Research Methods
Suggested Methods:
 User Interviews: To gain deep insights into personal routines, motivations, and
challenges.
 Usability Testing: To observe how users navigate the current fitness apps and
where confusion occurs.
Justification:
 Interviews will help understand emotional barriers and lifestyle-specific needs.
 Usability tests will reveal friction points in navigation and personalization
features.

government services."
2. Research Methods
Suggested Methods:
 Surveys: To identify common frustrations and general usability feedback from a
large user base.
